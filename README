jsHtmlToText is a *very* basic regex-based HTML stripper. 

It was created for a custom WebTV widget framework, which did not support other existing implementations.

Use it when:
* you need a minimal implementation
* don't have access to a proper JavaScript implementation (it was originally written for Konqueror )
* there no strong security requirements
